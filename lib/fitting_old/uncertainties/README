This is a slightly modified version of the uncertainties package Eric O. Lebigot.

See the Python Package Index (PyPI) and/or the github source repository (at
https://github.com/lebigot/uncertainties) for more complete documentations.

The changes here (forked at https://github.com/newville/uncertainties) enhances the
abilities to calculate uncertainties on arbitrarily complex python functions of
values with uncertainties.  This is important for Larch, and so the modded code
is included here.
