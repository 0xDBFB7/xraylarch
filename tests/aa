The current status is that TDL works as a nearly complete programming language, with control flow and conditionals, has pretty good data organization capabilities (similar to and expanded from Ifeffit's group idea), and semi-decent graphics. Much of the core numerical functionality needed for XAFS analysis (fitting, Fourier transforms, etc) are in place. In short, the hard part is close to done! There is still much left to be done in the application code area: essentially none of the XAFS functionality is written for TDL. However, there is a substantial amount of code written for data handling, including spec data, image files, xrf data processing, and modeling x-ray reflectivity. Please feel free to help contribute to the application code effort.
