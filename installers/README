This folder contains install scripts for Larch.   These include:

1.  conda_constructor - A folder with configuration files and resources
    to build stand-alone installers for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux.
    
2.  GetLarch.sh -  A shell script for installing on Linux/MacOSX.
    This downloads and installs a Miniconda Python to the "xraylarch"
    folder in your home directory.  This gives a dedicated Python
    environment for Larch.  The installer then selects and installs
    a few packages from the "conda-forge" conda channel, including
    wxPython and TomoPy which are not available for all platforms
    on PyPI. Finally, xraylarch is installed from PyPI.

    There are options for changing the "prefix" for the installation
    directory (default is $HOME/xraylarch) and for selecting
    whether wxPython and/or TomoPY are installed.

    wxPython is not required to use the Larch library, but all the
    graphical user interfaces and code for plotting and data
    visualization in Larch use wxPython.

    TomoPy is also not required, and is needed for tomographic
    reconstructions of X-ray fluorescence tomography data.  That is,
    if you are using Larch only for its XAFS, XRF, and XRF imaging
    tools, you do not need TomoPy.

    If you are interested in installing Larch in some way other than
    for an individual user, say on a Linux or MacOSX server, this
    shell script may be useful as a template.
    

3.  GetLarch.bat -  A Windows batch file for for installing on Windows.
    This follows the GetLarch.sh file in its approach, but is less
    complete.  It will need manual intervention and for steps to
    be run from a Terminal. This should definitely be used as a guide for
    the steps to take to install Larch on Windows.
