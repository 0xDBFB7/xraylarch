Autobk runs in about ~25 to 30 milliseconds on Rabbit (Quad Xeon E5440, 2.8GHz, 4Gb RAM, 32-bit Windows 7)

That is, 100 runs of test_autobk (read datafile, autobk, fft, filter) takes under 4 seconds:
  ~10 msec to read file
  ~23 msec for autobk
   ~3 msec for 2 FFTs (forward and back transform)

that is, one processor can reduce measured spectra at a rate approaching 100 kilo-spectra per hour.

For reference, Ifeffit takes about 100 milliseconds for the same operations.

Larch (pure Python) is 2.5x to 3x faster than Ifeffit (pure Fortran).

Tests do not include graphics (100 ms or so)
