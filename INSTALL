Installation instructions for Larch
========================================

To install the Larch, use::

   python setup.py install

On modern linux and OS X systems, you will probably need to install with super-user
privileges, as with::

   sude python setup.py install

Requirements and Dependencies
===============================

Python:
~~~~~~~

Larch requires Python 2.6 or higher.  Python 2.7 is *STRONGLY* recommended
if you have a choice.  Moderate testing has been done with Python 3.2, but
not all modules are available for it at this writing (June 2012).  At some
point in the near future, Larch will probably switch to Python 3, possibly
to only Python 3.

Several Python packages are also needed for Larch.  All of these are easily
installed, either as binary installs for Windows or Mac OS X, or as part of
your systems Package Management System for linux.  In addition, most of these
are easily installed from source or using Python's easy_install script.

Note that some Python distributions come with many of the required and
strongly recommended modules already installed.

Required Modules: Numpy and Scipy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Numpy and Scipy Packages are both required for Larch to work.  These
are available from http://scipy.org.

Strongly Recommended Modules: wxPython, matplotlib, and wxmplot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These modules are required for plotting data.

They are all available as simple installs:

  wxPython:   http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  matplotlib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/
  wxmplot:    https://github.com/newville/wxmplot

Recommended Modules: sqlalchemy, h5py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use data from the x-ray databases, the SQLAlchemy module must
be installed.  See http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

In order to read HDF5 files, the h5py package is needed. See
http://code.google.com/p/h5py/


What is Installed
===========================

The Larch installation process puts several files and directories on your computer.   A basic set of Python modules will be placed in the standard Python location on your machine, either something like
  /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/larch   on linux
  C:\Python2.7\libs\site-packages\larch    on Windows
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.7/site-packages/larch   on Mac OS X

The larch executable (or larch.bat) will be installed to
  /usr/bin/larch                on linux
  C:\Python2.7\bin\larch.bat    on Windows
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/larch on Mac OS X

In addition a directory is made for system-wide larch specific files,
including larch modules and plugins.  This directory will be

   /usr/share/larch/  on linux and Mac OS X
   C:\Program Files\larch on Windows

and will contain larch modules in a modules subdirectoy, and several larch
plugins in the plugins sub-directory.

You can create your own user larch directory (SHOULD BE CREATED AT INSTALL!)

FIXME---
   $HOME/.larch/  on linux and Mac OS X
   APPDIR\larch    on Windows
FIXME--


Customization of Installation
===============================

The location of the the system-wide and per-user larch directories can be configured by editing the simple file
lib/site_configdata.py

prior to installation.
