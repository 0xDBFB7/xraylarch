Installation instructions for Larch
========================================

To install the Larch, use::

   python setup.py install

On modern linux and OS X systems, you will probably need to install with super-user
privileges, as with::

   sude python setup.py install

Requirements and Dependencies
===============================

Python:
~~~~~~~

Larch requires Python 2.6 or higher.  Python 2.7 is *STRONGLY* recommended
if you have a choice.  Moderate testing has been done with Python 3.2, but
not all modules are available for it at this writing (June 2012).  At some
point in the near future, Larch will probably switch to Python 3, possibly
to only Python 3.

Several Python packages are also needed for Larch.  All of these are easily
installed, either as binary installs for Windows or Mac OS X, or as part of
your systems Package Management System for linux.  In addition, most of these
are easily installed from source or using Python's easy_install script.

Note that some Python distributions come with many of the required and
strongly recommended modules already installed.

Required Modules: Numpy and Scipy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Numpy and Scipy Packages are both required for Larch to work.  These
are available from http://scipy.org.

Strongly Recommended Modules: wxPython, matplotlib, and wxmplot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These modules are required for plotting data.

They are all available as simple installs:

  wxPython:   http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  matplotlib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/
  wxmplot:    https://github.com/newville/wxmplot

Recommended Modules: sqlalchemy, h5py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use data from the x-ray databases, the SQLAlchemy module must
be installed.  See http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

In order to read HDF5 files, the h5py package is needed. See
http://code.google.com/p/h5py/


What is Installed
===========================

The Larch installation process puts several files and directories on your computer.
A basic set of Python modules will be placed in the standard Python location on your
machine, at locations like these:

  /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/larch   on linux
  C:\Python2.7\libs\site-packages\larch    on Windows
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.7/site-packages/larch   on Mac OS X

The larch executable (or larch.bat) will be installed to

  /usr/bin/larch               on linux
  C:\Python2.7\bin\larch.bat   on Windows
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/larch on Mac OS X

In addition, a directory is made for system-wide larch files, including
larch modules and plugins.  This directory will be

   /usr/share/larch/           on linux and Mac OS X
   C:\Program Files\larch      on Windows

and will contain larch modules in a modules subdirectoy, and several larch
plugins in the plugins sub-directory.

Finally, a directory is made for user-specific larch files, including an
initialization script, 'init.lar', to be run at startup, a history file,
'history.lar', containing the command history for past larch sessions, and
folders named 'matplotlib', 'modules', and 'plugins'.  The 'matplotlib'
folder may be used by the plotting libraries, for example to store fonts.
The 'modules' and 'plugins' folders are the place to put user-specific
modules and plugins, respectively.

On linux and Mac OS X, the larch directory will be called '.larch'.  On
Windows it will be 'larch'.The exact location of your larch directory
varies from system to system, but should be in one of

  /Users/USERRNAME/.larch
  /home/USERNAME/.larch
  C:\Users\USERNAME\larch
  C:\ProgramData\larch


Customization of Installation
===============================

The location of the the system-wide and per-user larch directories can be
configured by editing the simple file lib/site_configdata.py.
Currently, this file looks like this::

   unix_installdir = '/usr/share/larch'
   unix_userdir    = '.larch'

   win_installdir = 'C:\\Program Files\\larch'
   win_userdir    = 'larch'

You can customize the installed locations by adjusting these values prior
to installation.
