Larch
=====================================

Larch is a scientific data processing language that is designed to be

    * easy to use for novices.
    * complete enough for intermediate and advanced data processing.
    * data-centric, so that arrays of scientific data are easy to use and organize.
    * easily extensible with Python.

Larch has been developed especially for tools and algorithms for analyzing
x-ray spectroscopic and scattering data, especially the kind of data
collected at modern synchrotrons and x-ray sources.  Larch has several
related target application areas, including:

  * XAFS analysis, becoming version Ifeffit Version2.
  * tools for micro-XRF mapping visualization and analysis.
  * quantitative XRF analysis.
  * X-ray standing waves and surface scattering analysis.
  * Data collection software for the abover.

The expectation is that having these different problem areas connected by a
common *macro language* will strengthen all these application areas.
