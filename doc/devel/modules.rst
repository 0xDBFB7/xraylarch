Modules
==================

Larch can import modules either written in Larch (with a '.lar' extension) or
Python (with a '.py' extension).  When importing a Python module, the full
set of Python objects is imported as a module, which looks and acts exactly
like a Larch Group.   Yes, there is really not much more to it.
