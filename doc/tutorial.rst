Larch Tutorial
============================

This chapter describes the Larch language and provides an introduction into
processing data using Larch.  An important goal of Larch is to make writing
and modifying data analysis as simple as possible.  The tutorial here tries
to make few assumptions about your experience with scientific
programming. On the other hand, Larch is a language for processing of
scientific data, the expected audience is expected to have a technical
background, familiarity with using programs for scientific data analysis.
In addition, some understanding of the concepts of how scientific data is
stored on computers and of the basics of programming.


The Larch language is heavily based on Python, and implemented in Python.
Knowledge of Python will greatly simplify learning Larch, and vice versa.
This shared syntax is, of course, intended as well, as Python can be used
to extend Larch.  Thus, for further details and additional information, see
the Python documentation at http://python.org/

Getting Started
=================== 

This tutorial expects that you already have Larch installed and can run
either the program larch, basic Larch interpreter, or wxlarch, the enhanced
GUI interpreter::
  
   C> larch
     Larch 0.9.5  M. Newville, T. Trainor (2009)
     using python 2.6.5, numpy 1.5.1
   larch>  

For Windows and Mac OS X users, executable applications will be available.
